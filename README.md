FOR TEST PURPOSE ONLY.

# How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/o-mega/rollup-ts-error.git
cd rollup-ts-error
yarn
yarn build
```

It will creates the `./dist` folder with compiled bundles.
As you can see, at `dist/index.d.ts` - there is no includes for `ExampleProps` as it should. And even more, it reffers to nowhere.
